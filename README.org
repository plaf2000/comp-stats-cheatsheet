** Local build instructions 
In case you want to compile locally, here are the instructions provided by [[https://github.com/RomeoV/][RomeoV]].

Although a pdf file is provided, you can build the pdf yourself.
You need to have a distribution of ~Latex~ aswell as the command-line tool ~minted~ installed (~dnf install python3-pygments~). Then, clone the repository and the submodule and build it:
#+BEGIN_SRC
$ pdflatex --version
pdfTeX 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023/Fedora 40) [...]
$ pygmentize -V
Pygments version 2.17.2 [...]
$ git clone --recursive git@github.com:ib31iat/comp-stats-cheatsheet.git
$ pdflatex -shell-escape formulary.tex
#+END_SRC
Sometimes the first run of ~pdflatex~ fails with error ~LaTeX Error: Can be used only in preamble.~
Cancel the compilation (with =X<Enter>=) and rerun the command.
